CMSC 100: Exercise 02 <br>
Task: Create a single-page static portfolio website using HTML and CSS. The page from your website must be written from scratch, without using any CSS framework and JavaScript Library.

Section: U-1L

Live Website Link: (to be added, because the instructions said disregard github.io for the mean time) <br><br>
Steps to create Github Page:
  1. Create a public repository named username.github.io, where username is your username (or organization name) on GitHub.
  2. Clone the repository on your local computer.
  3. Enter the project folder and add an index.html file.
  4. Add, commit, and push your changes.

Key takeaways from this exercise: <br>
- I have managed to familiarize myself more with the CSS syntax, and I learned a thing or two about flexbox and how it is very useful to make an organized/well-designed website.
